    "body": " <p class='mb-4'>Renting a dumpster in Lubbock can simplify projects from home cleanouts to commercial construction. But choosing the wrong size or not knowing local rules can cost time and money. This guide from <strong>Dumpster Rentals Lubbock</strong> explains common roll-off dumpster sizes, typical uses, pricing structure, permit needs in Lubbock, and best practices to keep your rental smooth and compliant.</p> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>Common Dumpster Sizes & What They Fit</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Roll-off dumpsters are measured in cubic yards. Below are the most common sizes you\u2019ll see in Lubbock and the projects they\u2019re good for:</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>10-yard dumpster</strong>: Great for small cleanouts, garage clear-outs, and minor remodeling jobs. Holds roughly 3-4 pickup truck loads.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>15-yard dumpster</strong>: Ideal for medium home projects like bathroom remodels or flooring replacement.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>20-yard dumpster</strong>: One of the most popular options for larger remodels, roof tear-offs, and larger yard waste projects.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>30-yard dumpster</strong>: Suited for major renovations and major construction debris.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>40-yard dumpster</strong>: Best for large commercial jobs, whole-house cleanouts, or major demolition work.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class='text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2'><strong>Quick Size Tip</strong></h3> <p class='mb-4'>If you\u2019re unsure, homeowners often choose a 20-yard dumpster for whole-room renovations and a 30-yard for whole-house projects. Our team at <strong>Dumpster Rentals Lubbock</strong> can recommend the right size based on photos or a quick project description.</p> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>How Dumpster Pricing Works in Lubbock</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Most dumpster rentals follow a simple pricing model: a base flat rate (delivery, pickup, and a set rental period), plus weight overages and any special disposal fees. Factors that influence price:</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Size</strong>: Larger dumpsters cost more up-front.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Weight</strong>: Most rentals include a weight allowance; heavy materials like concrete, dirt, or brick may incur extra fees.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Material type</strong>: Yard waste, household junk, and construction debris can have different disposal costs \u2014 hazardous materials are prohibited or require special handling.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Rental duration & logistics</strong>: Longer rental windows or complicated delivery locations (narrow alleys, need for permits) can raise costs.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>Permits & Street Placement in Lubbock</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>If your dumpster will sit on a public street or sidewalk in Lubbock, a city permit is often required. Driveway placements typically do not need permits but require care to protect the surface. We handle most permit coordination for customers \u2014 just tell us where you want the dumpster placed when booking, or call us at <strong>[phone]</strong> for guidance.</p> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>What You Can and Cannot Put in a Roll-Off Dumpster</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Knowing prohibited items before loading saves time and avoids extra fees. Common prohibited items include:</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Hazardous materials</strong>: Tires, motor oil, gasoline, batteries, paints, pesticides, and solvents. These require special disposal.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Electronics</strong>: Some e-waste must be recycled separately under state/local regulations.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Asbestos-containing materials</strong>: Must be handled by certified abatement professionals.</p></li> </ul> <p class='mb-4'>Acceptable items typically include household junk, furniture, appliances (check local regulations for refrigerants), construction debris, roofing shingles, and yard waste. If you\u2019re unsure about a specific item, call <strong>Dumpster Rentals Lubbock</strong> at <strong>[phone]</strong> or upload a photo via our contact page.</p> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>Preparing for Delivery & Safety Tips</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Follow these tips to ensure safe delivery and pickup:</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Clear the placement area</strong>: Make sure the driveway or street parking spot is accessible and free of low-hanging wires and obstructions.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Protect surfaces</strong>: Place wooden boards under the dumpster\u2019s wheels to prevent driveway damage when needed.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Load evenly</strong>: Distribute heavy items across the dumpster to prevent tipping and avoid overfilling past the top rails.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Keep hazardous materials separate</strong>: Arrange for proper disposal of paints, solvents, and household chemicals before loading the dumpster.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>Recycling & Responsible Disposal in Lubbock</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Dumpster Rentals Lubbock partners with local landfills and recycling centers to divert eligible materials when possible. Roofing shingles, metal, concrete, and clean wood can often be recycled or repurposed.
